            <h2>Short Bio</h2>
            <p>
                I’m a frontend developer with a passion for creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces. My journey into tech began with curiosity and the desire to bring ideas to life through design and code. From learning the basics of HTML and CSS to exploring JavaScript and responsive layouts, every new project has strengthened my creativity and problem-solving skills. I love transforming ideas into visually appealing and interactive experiences that make users feel connected.

            <h2>Goals in this Program</h2>
            <p>
                My goal in the HNG program is to grow beyond just writing code — I want to build confidence, learn to collaborate effectively, and gain hands-on experience working in a professional developer environment. I see this internship as a bridge between where I am and where I aspire to be: a frontend developer capable of contributing to real-world products that impact people’s lives. I’m eager to connect with other talented interns, share knowledge, and take on challenges that push me outside my comfort zone.

            <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
            <p>
                I’m currently working to improve my confidence in <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>design concepts</strong>. Sometimes I hesitate when tackling complex logic or structuring interactive features, but I’m learning to take it one step at a time. 
                I’m focusing on building more projects to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript, while also improving my eye for layout, color balance, and visual hierarchy. Each project brings me closer to becoming both a better developer and a stronger designer.

                Hey Future Me! Remember this feeling of excitement and challenge. Don't lose sight of why you started. Keep learning, keep building, and don't be afraid to ask for help or admit when you don't know something. The journey is continuous, and every bug you fix makes you a better developer. Stay curious!

            <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                I'm particularly excited about the potential of web components and how they can lead to more modular and reusable code. I'm also keen to explore UI/UX principles further to ensure the interfaces I build are not just functional, but also intuitive and delightful for users. The web is constantly evolving, and I'm eager to evolve with it!
