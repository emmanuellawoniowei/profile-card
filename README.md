# Profile Card & Multi-Page Application

This project has evolved from a single responsive profile card into a multi-page application. It now includes a "Contact Us" page with robust form validation and an "About Me" page for project information/contributor details, alongside the original profile card. The entire application maintains a sleek, dark-themed design with elegant gold accents, and showcases responsive design principles.

## Demos
